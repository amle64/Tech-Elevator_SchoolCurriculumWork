            <blockquote> <cite="https://bluelock.fandom.com/wiki/Yoichi_Isagi">
                No matter how much you try to understand other people's hearts, people aren't able to change others. And that's why every time, you have to change yourself     
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote> <cite="https://bluelock.fandom.com/wiki/Yoichi_Isagi">
                You shouldn't aim to be the one that gets chosen but the one that chooses
