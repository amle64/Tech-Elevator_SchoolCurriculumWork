     * For the purposes of this exercise, the following naming rules are tested:
     *
     * Variable names:
     *  - must start with a lowercase character a-z.
     *  - underscore ('_') characters are not allowed.
     *  - dollar sign ('$') characters are not allowed.
     *  - must be at least two characters in length.
     *  - You are encouraged to create descriptive names and are required to camel case them as appropriate.
     *
     * Constant names:
     *  - must start with an uppercase character A-Z.
     *  - dollar sign ('$') characters are not allowed.
     *  - must be at least two characters in length.
     *  - You are encouraged to create descriptive names and are required to upper case them as appropriate.
     *
     * Due to practical limitations, camel case and pascal case are not tested other than checking the first
     * character of the name is lower case for variables and upper case for constants. Your instructor will
     * manually review your solution checking for the correct casing.
